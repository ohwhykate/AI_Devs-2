# AI_Devs-2
(https://www.aidevs.pl/#program)[https://www.aidevs.pl/#program]
In this repository, I document the completion of tasks within the scope of AIDevs2. After each completed lesson, I was presented with either a prompt engineering task or API tasks, which involved writing simple scripts that connected application logic with the use of artificial intelligence solutions (mostly OpenAI models). The repository consists of an 'api_tasks' folder, containing scripts for tasks and task descriptions (task_content.md), and a 'prompt_tasks' folder, where my solutions to each task are documented.
